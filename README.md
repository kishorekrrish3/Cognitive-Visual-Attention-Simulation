# 🧠 Cognitive Visual Attention Simulation

A **Streamlit-based Cognitive AI project** that simulates how human visual attention works.  
This project demonstrates how a cognitive system processes an image using **saliency maps**, **fixation-based scanning**, and **attention prioritization** to mimic human-like perception.  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Upload any image (PNG/JPG) for simulation.  
- 🎯 Generates a **saliency map** using OpenCV to highlight important regions.  
- 👀 Simulates **fixation points** that mimic eye-tracking movements.  
- ⚙️ Adjustable parameters:
  - Blur kernel size
  - Saliency threshold
  - Maximum fixations  
- 📊 Interactive Streamlit UI with side panel controls.  
- 📖 Footer explaining each cognitive AI concept in simple terms.

## 🖼️ How It Works

### 1. **Input Image**

You upload an image which acts as the visual scene.

### 2. **Saliency Map**

* The system computes a **saliency map** (regions of interest).
* Saliency = areas in the image that "stand out" (color contrast, edges, intensity).

### 3. **Fixation Simulation**

* The algorithm simulates **eye movements**.
* Human eyes jump between points (fixations) instead of scanning line-by-line.
* System chooses **top N salient points** as fixation spots.

### 4. **Visualization**

* Original image displayed.
* Saliency map heat overlay shown.
* Fixation points marked on the image.

## 📘 Cognitive AI Concepts Used

| Term                 | Meaning                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Saliency Map**     | Highlights important areas of an image that naturally grab attention.               |
| **Fixation**         | A point where the human eye pauses briefly while scanning a scene.                  |
| **Visual Attention** | Cognitive process of focusing on relevant parts of the scene while ignoring others. |
| **Thresholding**     | Used to filter out low-importance areas from the saliency map.                      |
| **Cognitive AI**     | AI methods inspired by how humans think, perceive, and process information.         |

## 📚 Future Improvements

* 🔮 Add **real eye-tracking data** integration.
* 🖼️ Allow **video input** instead of static images.
* 📊 Add **heatmaps** for attention over time.
* 🤖 Combine with **deep learning models** for object detection + attention.

---

## 🏫 Academic Value

This project fits well for **Cognitive AI coursework** because:

* It links **perception & attention** with AI techniques.
* Explains **cognitive psychology** concepts via simulation.
* Has enough technical depth (image processing + AI).
* Yet remains lightweight for demonstration.
